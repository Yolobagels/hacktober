# Sample program repository

This is a repository for sample programs!
Feel free to add in any sample program you want, but be sure to cite the source if it's from somewhere!

## Best Practices

1. Don't PR the same program here (obviously)
2. Fork the repo, branch and then PR your addition
3. 1 branch per program please


## To-Do
1. Organise the repository by languages
