# Singapore Sample Program Repository

This is a repository for sample programs, bonus points if you're from Singapore!
This repository aims to bring the Singaporean coding community closer, everyone else is of course welcome to contribute.
Feel free to add in any sample program you want, but be sure to cite the source if it's from somewhere!

## Best Practices

1. Don't PR the same program here (obviously)
2. Fork the repo, branch and then PR your addition
3. 1 branch per program please


## To-Do
1. Organise the repository by languages
